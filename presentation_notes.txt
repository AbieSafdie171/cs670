- Define the COFI dataset and what it tracks ---> coastal ecosystem data and their health
	- locations of data, depth, etc...
	- show plot locations

- Describe the problem --> rising sea level temperatures... what effect does that have on the health of these ecosystems
	- cite nasa data stating ocean temperatures are rising
	- JUST SHOW THE NASA DATA BC ITS PROBABLY OK TO DO THIS BC IT JUST SETS UP THE PREMISE OF WHAT I AM TRYING TO SHOW/PREDICT

- Express the critical importance of phytoplankton
	- keystone species
	- 30-50 percent of all carbon emitted by humans is aborbed by plankton
		- largest carbon sink in the world
		- it is of CRITICAL importance that this carbon sink remains functional for the overall health of the planet

	- QUESTIONS TO ANSWER:
		- How does the amount of plankton change with temperature... Is there a relationship? 
			- how does this influence oxygen saturation...
				- im expecting: 
					- oxygen rich = high chlorophyll (plankton)
					- hypxic = low chlorohpyll (plankton)

		- How does the level of nutirents change w temperature...
		- Look at C14As1, C14As2 (amount of carbon absorbed by phtoplankton) relation to temperature
		- MeanAs (The average primary productivity rate)
		- pH1, pH2 (ocean aciditity, which affects coral reefs, shell-building organisms, and overall marine chemistry.)
		- DIC1, DIC2 (Dissolved Inorganic Carbon) â†’ The amount of carbon available in the ocean for photosynthesis and ocean acidification processes.



- Models I can use to answer the questions/make predictions
	- Linear Regression for plankton values based on tempearutes
		- experiment w/ lasso, ridge regularization		<--- probably use ridge bc there is multicollinearity
		- polynomial regression/multiple linear regression
		- CROSS-VALIDATION
			- confustion matrices ex to mesasure performance
	- Boosted Trees (apparently better for non-linear relationships)
