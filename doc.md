## The CALCOFI Dataset


The CALCOFI (California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations) dataset tracks oceanic data off the coast of California. This data is retrieved via bottle samples dropped at various depths at different oceanic locations. These samples retrieve data on many different indicators of ocean health. For example, CO2 measurements, pH levels, nutrient densities (e.g. phostphate, nitrite, ammonium, etc), ocean temperatures, oxygen saturations, and plankton levels. 

Below is a visual (created by me using R) of the locations off the coast of California where data samples were taken.

## Questions







- Define the COFI dataset and what it tracks ---> coastal ecosystem data and their health
	- locations of data, depth, etc...
	- show plot locations
